These are software that are not related to robotics/research and are things I like to build as a tinkerer.\n\n## Robotics\n\n1. [**QTMWrapper**](https://github.com/shreeram-murali/QTMWrapper): A toolkit to enable autonomous systems integration with Qualisys motion capture measurements. \n\t- **Tools**: Python (multithreading, asyncio)\n2. [**crazypaths**](https://github.com/shreeram-murali/crazypaths): A command-line interface (CLI) for path planning quadrotor trajectories using motion capture positioning in the high-level control loop.\n    -   **Tools**: Python, Git\n3. [**2DOF Antenna Vectoring**](https://github.com/shreeram-murali/2DOF-antenna-vectoring): Programs that calculate azimuth and elevation angles for positioning a tracker towards a UAV based on GPS data.\n\t  -   **Tools**: Python, NodeMCU (ESP32), socket\n4.  [**ROS Navigation Templates**](https://github.com/shreeram-murali/ros-navigation-templates): Templates for developing controller and navigation nodes using the ROS Navigation Stack.\n    -   **Tools**: Python, ROS Melodic\n5.  [**Edhitha UAS**](https://www.edhitha.com): A competitive student team that I was a part of (and eventually led) during my undergraduate studies. The team develops UAVs for autonomous navigation, imagery, obstacle avoidance, and other interdisciplinary objectives.\n\n## Software\n1. [**Password Manager CLI**](https://github.com/shreeram-murali/password-manager-cli): A command-line based local password manager that uses Fernet encryption to locally store your passwords.\n\t- **Tools**: Python, Docker (WIP)","lastmodified":"2022-07-28T17:45:41.00448463Z","tags":null},"/notes/Research":{"title":"Research","content":"## Background\nIn Fall 2018, during my undergraduate studies, I attended a seminar which dissected the working of commonly used flight controllers on aerial vehicles. It simplified their operation from this obscure notion of automation in our everyday skies to an understandable electronic system that controls a vehicle to follow a planned path. \n\nIn the following weeks, I joined a [competitive student team](https://www.edhitha.com/) that worked on autonomous aerial vehicles. I got to work on GPS-aided autonomous navigation for applications such as obstacle avoidance, imagery, and air delivery. In the following months, I became highly familiar with off-the-shelf embedded controllers and software that could be used to achieve autonomy for various mobile robots, including aerial vehicles, ground vehicles, and underwater vehicles. \n\nWhile I became comfortable with building and operating such mobile robots, I wanted to learn how to control them. I joined the Data Augmented Control of Autonomous Systems (DACAS) Lab, led by [Dr. Jishnu Keshavan](https://mecheng.iisc.ac.in/people/jishnu-keshavan/), at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. My work here involves simulation and experimentation of various adaptive control strategies for mobile robot navigation and applications such as formation control and autonomous landing.","lastmodified":"2022-07-28T17:45:41.00448463Z","tags":null}}
