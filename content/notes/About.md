## Bio

I'm an incoming master's student (M.Sc.) of EECS at [Aalto University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aalto_University). I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) in mechanical engineering from [Ramaiah Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramaiah_Institute_of_Technology) in 2021.

I'm currenty a junior research assistant with the Data Augmented Control of Autonomous Systems (DACAS) Lab, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. 

To read more about my research interests, please click [[notes/Research|here]], but the long-story-short is that I started off by building mobile robots, then learnt how to operate them, but now I'm interested in the more intrinsic aspects of how to control them.
