title: "Projects"

The projects on this page are broadly classified under 2 categories:
1. **Robotics**: Projects and codes that are, in some way, broadly related to robotics and robotics reasearch that I pursue.
2. **Software**: Other software that are usually applications, such as command-line applications or web applications, that I've built. These are software that are not related to robotics/research and are things I like to build as a tinkerer.

## Robotics

1. [**QTMWrapper**](https://github.com/shreeram-murali/QTMWrapper): A toolkit to enable autonomous systems integration with Qualisys motion capture measurements. 
	- **Tools**: Python (multithreading, asyncio)
2. [**crazypaths**](https://github.com/shreeram-murali/crazypaths): A command-line interface (CLI) for path planning quadrotor trajectories using motion capture positioning in the high-level control loop.
    -   **Tools**: Python, Git
3. [**2DOF Antenna Vectoring**](https://github.com/shreeram-murali/2DOF-antenna-vectoring): Programs that calculate azimuth and elevation angles for positioning a tracker towards a UAV based on GPS data.
	  -   **Tools**: Python, NodeMCU (ESP32), socket
4.  [**ROS Navigation Templates**](https://github.com/shreeram-murali/ros-navigation-templates): Templates for developing controller and navigation nodes using the ROS Navigation Stack.
    -   **Tools**: Python, ROS Melodic
5.  [**Edhitha UAS**](https://www.edhitha.com): A competitive student team that I was a part of (and eventually led) during my undergraduate studies. The team develops UAVs for autonomous navigation, imagery, obstacle avoidance, and other interdisciplinary objectives.

## Software
1. [**Password Manager CLI**](https://github.com/shreeram-murali/password-manager-cli): A command-line based local password manager that uses Fernet encryption to locally store your passwords.
	- **Tools**: Python, Docker (WIP)
