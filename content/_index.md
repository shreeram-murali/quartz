Hi, my name is Shreeram Murali, and I’m currently a research assistant at the Data Augmented Control of Autonomous Systems (DACAS) Lab, [Indian Institute of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Science), Bangalore. 

I am interested in researching learning-based control strategies for mobile robot navigation. More on my research interests [[notes/Research|here]].

Outside of academics, I am also a photography and film enthusiast. More about me [[notes/About|here]], where you'll also find my [[notes/About#Contact|contact details]].
